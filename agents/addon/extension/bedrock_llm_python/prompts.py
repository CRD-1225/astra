DEFAULT_PUNCATION_PROMPT = """I am doing simultaneous interpretation, the following is partial output from the ASR system. I need to quickly find the content that can be interpretated from it. 

## Task
I need you to carefully add punctuation to it, don't rush, I will then split it based on the punctuation.

## Context
Prior asr content(maybe empty), use it to revise your translate:
```
{prior_asr_content}
```

## ASR Content
```
{content}
```

## Rules
1. Please only add necessary punctuation marks to the ASR content, do not add, delete or change any words.
2. NEVER modify existing puncations.
3. If the ASR content is incomplete or ambiguous, please keep it as is.
4. Only output the result, no explaination or preamble content."""
